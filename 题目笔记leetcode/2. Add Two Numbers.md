## 2. Add Two Numbers

https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1, l2):
        dummy = ListNode(0)
        cur = dummy
        p, q = l1, l2
        value = 0
        carry = 0
        curvalue = 0
        while p or q:
            val1 = p.val if p else 0
            val2 = q.val if q else 0
            value = val1 + val2 + carry
            carry = value // 10
            curvalue = value % 10
            cur.next = ListNode(curvalue)
            cur = cur.next
            if p:
                p = p.next
            if q:
                q = q.next
        if carry > 0:
            cur.next = ListNode(carry)
        return dummy.next
```

## 解题思路
Very straight forward, please note even question said the digits are sorted in reverse order, it doesn't mean we have to reverse list to get the right sequence.
On the contrary,the question just give us the right sequence. 431 + 532, it looks like we have to add from 4 and 5, actually we start from the unit digit, so 
we can traverse 2 lists, and add them together. If sum is > 10, we can add a carry to the next value.
