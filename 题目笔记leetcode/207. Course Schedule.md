## 207. Course Schedule

https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/

My solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canFinish(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        :type numCourses: int
        :type prerequisites: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # Create map for each course 
        preMap = {i:[] for i in range(numCourses)}
        # Get each prerequisites for single number
        for course, pre in prerequisites:
            preMap[course].append(pre)
            
        # VisitSet = all courses along the curr DFS path
        visitSet = set()
        
        def dfs(course):
            # Base set, means in the loop
            if course in visitSet:
                return False
            # This course has no prerequisites
            if preMap[course] == []:
                return True
            
            visitSet.add(course)
            for pre in preMap[course]:
                # If one of the course can not be taken, return false immediatly.
                if not dfs(pre): return False
            visitSet.remove(course)
            preMap[course] = []
            return True
        
        for course in range(numCourses):
            if not dfs(course): return False
        
        return True         
```

## 解题思路和想法
The problem could be modeled as another graph traversal problem, where each course can be represented as a vertex in a graph and the dependency between the 
courses can be modeled as a directed edge between two vertex.

As a reminder, backtracking is a general algorithm that is often applied to solve the constraint satisfaction problems, which incrementally builds candidates 
to the solutions, and abandons a candidate (i.e. backtracks) as soon as it determines that the candidate would not lead to a valid solution.

Step 1). we build a graph data structure from the given list of course dependencies. Here we adopt the adjacency list data structure as shown below to 
represent the graph, which can be implemented via hashmap or dictionary. Each entry in the adjacency list represents a node which consists of a node index 
and a list of neighbors nodes that follow from the node. 

Step 2). we then enumerate each node (course) in the constructed graph, to check if we could form a dependency cycle starting from the node.

Step 3). we perform the cyclic check via backtracking, where we breadcrumb our path (i.e. mark the nodes we visited) to detect if we come across a
previously visited node (hence a cycle detected). We also remove the breadcrumbs for each iteration.
