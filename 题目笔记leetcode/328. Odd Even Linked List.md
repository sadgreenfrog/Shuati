328. Odd Even Linked List

https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def oddEvenList(self, head):
        if not head: return head
        dummy1 = ListNode(next = head)
        dummy2 = ListNode(next = head.next)
        cur1 = head
        cur2 = cur1.next
        while cur1.next and cur2.next:
            #cur2.next = temp
            cur1.next = cur2.next
            cur1 = cur1.next
            cur2.next = cur1.next
            cur2 = cur2.next
        cur1.next = dummy2.next
        return dummy1.next
    
```
## 解题思路
Intuitive method: 2 pointers, one for odd, one for even. When traverse to the end point, place the head of even list after the odd end.

One thing worth to notice, the while condition should be cur1.next and cur2.next. Always examine if the node is null before we call the next field.
And carefully define the end conditions of the loop. In this problem, we have to make sure cur.next is not null, because we will assign it to other node. 
So cur should not be the last one. In other problems, we don't need something from .next, like just counting. In that case, we can just while head.
