240. Search a 2D Matrix II

https://leetcode.com/problems/search-a-2d-matrix-ii/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def searchMatrix(self, matrix, target):
        m, n = len(matrix)-1, len(matrix[0])-1
        row, col = 0, n
        while 0 <= row <= m and 0 <= col <= n:
            if matrix[row][col] == target:
                return True
            elif matrix[row][col] < target:
                row += 1
            else:
                col -= 1
        return False
```
## 解题思路

I pick the rop right element in the matrix, if the target is larger than current value, row += 1. Opposite, col -= 1. It is not too tricky to see why doing this will never prune the correct answer; because the rows are sorted from left-to-right, we know that every value to the left of the current value is smaller. Therefore, if the current value is already larger than target, we know that every value to its right will also be too large. We will move to left.
