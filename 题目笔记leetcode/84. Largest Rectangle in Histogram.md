        area, maxa = 0, 0
        # find before and after 
        for i in range(n):

## 解题思路
ement 
1. Brute Force: Iterate through the heights and calculate max area of each height. One for loop to locate the current height, then using 2 pointers 
to find the index of the element which just smaller than current one on the left and right respectively.

2. We can take the full array and split it in half, the maximum Area achievable by the array is the largest of:
. The maximum area achievable in the left half alone.
. The maximum area achievable in the right half alone.
. The maximum area achievable by combining both halves.
