My Solution

```python
class Solution:
class Solution(object):
    def trap(self, height):
        
        if not height: return 0
        n = len(height)
        maxleft = [0 for i in range(n)]
        maxright = [0 for i in range(n)]
        # From the front to the end
        maxleft_value = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            maxleft[i] = maxleft_value
            if height[i] > maxleft_value:
                maxleft_value = height[i]
        maxright_value = 0
        for j in range(len(height)-1, -1, -1):
            maxright[j] = maxright_value
            if height[j] > maxright_value:
                maxright_value = height[j]
        water = 0
        s = 0
        for i in range(len(height)):
            s = min(maxleft[i], maxright[i]) - height[i]
            if s <= 0:
                continue
            else:
                water += s
        return water              
```
## 思路想法

1. Intuitive thinking: 
The key point to decide the volumn of water is the boundary of the left and right. We have to find out the min(left, right), which is the lowest boundary to
contain the water. Left & Right would be the maxium height from the left and right of this index. 

Just think about single postion, each index is a cube, the water we can contain is w = min(l, r) - height[i], if w < 0, it means can not contain on this point.
We don't add it, if > 0, we can add to the result. We can momorize on each point, how many water is trapped at that position. So we can iterate the list
2 times to let the min(l,r) of the posotion.
