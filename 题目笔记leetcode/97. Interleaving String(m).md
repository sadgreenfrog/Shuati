## 97. Interleaving String

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/

My Solution

```python
#----------------------------Recursion--------------------------#
class Solution:
    def isInterleave(self, s1: str, s2: str, s3: str) -> bool:
        N = len(s3)
        A,B = len(s1), len(s2)
        if A+B != N: return False
        def rec(i,j,k): # 3 pointers
            if i == A and j == B and k == N: return True
            
            b1, b2 = False, False
            if i < A and s1[i] == s3[k]: # i++,k++,continue compare. So we move to next iteration
                b1 = rec(i+1, j, k+1)
            if j < B and s2[j] == s3[k]:
                b2 = rec(i, j+1, k+1)
            return b1 or b2 # Feed the result back to upper level, if the condition touch base and not meet if i == A and j == B and k == N, retutn False.
        return rec(0,0,0)

        if A+B != N: return False
        record = {} # Record at (i,j,k), it is true or false
        def rec(i,j,k, record): # 3 pointers
            if (i,j,k) in record: return record[(i,j,k)]
            if i == A and j == B and k == N: return True

            return b1 or b2 # Feed the result back to upper level, if the condition touch base and not meet if i == A and j == B and k == N, retutn False.
        return rec(0,0,0,record)

## 解题思路和想法
2 pointers: Will not work.

Initial intuiation is to use 3 pointers for s1,s2,s3. Compare s1,s1 with s3, when there is a match, we can move the p1/p2 pointers to the right. The iusse here
is when s1,s2 has the same value as s3, we don't know which one to move. 

Then we need recursive to help us traverse the s2, if s1 not work. The first version is recursion which not pass, time exceeded.
