## 912. Sort an Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-an-array/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def sortArray(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:    
        # Top-down
        def rec(l, r, nums):
            # Termination
            if l >= r:
                return
            """
            Single layer:
            Find mid, then split into 2 lists
            """
            mid = l + (r-l) // 2
            # It means it's already sorted
            rec(l, mid, nums)
            rec(mid+1, r, nums)
            
            firsthalf = l
            secondhalf = mid+1
            merged = []
            while firsthalf <= mid or secondhalf <= r:
                if secondhalf > r or (firsthalf <= mid and nums[firsthalf] <= nums[secondhalf]):
                    merged.append(nums[firsthalf])
                    firsthalf += 1
                elif firsthalf > mid or secondhalf <= r and nums[firsthalf] > nums[secondhalf]:
                    merged.append(nums[secondhalf])
                    secondhalf += 1
            nums[l: r+1] = merged     
        rec(0, len(nums)-1, nums)
        return nums
```

## 解题思路和想法

Divide and Concur, merge sort.

1. Split the lists into firstpart and secondpart from the middle until only one element left.

2. When it touched the base case, 1st part and 2nd part will have only one element respectively, then apply normal compare and adjust the sequence.

3. Then return to the higher level.
