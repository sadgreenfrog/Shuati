My Solution

    def findDiagonalOrder(self, mat: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        
        
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])

                if i >= 0 and j < n:
                    cur = mat[i][j]

## 思路想法

1. Simulation: Have lots of rules and edge cases need to be considered into, need accumulate more ability on comprehensive thinking. First we need to
consider directions of diagnal, in the example, odd will come down to up, even will come up to down. From the matrix we can know, mxn matrix, we
will have m+n-1 diganols. So we will itereate m+n-1 times to insert the list into final list. We can also use it ae the indicator of odd and even.
Secondly, when the direction transfer, the next head of direction will be different on either side of "Edge direction". After considering all of
this we can make out this solution.


2. A common statergy for solving a lot of programming problem is to first solve a striooed down, simpler version of them. Instead of thinking about
the zigzag pattern of printing for the diagonals. Let's print out the contents of matrix, on diagnal after the other.
