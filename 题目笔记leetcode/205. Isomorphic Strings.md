My Solution

```python
#-----------------Error----------------------#
class Solution(object):
    def isIsomorphic(self, s, t):
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
        sp, tp = 1, 1
        while sp < len(s) and tp < len(s):
            if s[sp] != s[sp-1]:
                if t[tp] != t[tp-1]:
                    sp += 1
                    tp += 1
                else:
                    return False
            else:
                if t[tp] == t[tp-1]:
                    sp += 1
                    tp += 1
                else:
                    return False
        return True

    def isIsomorphic(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        st_map = {}
        ts_map = {}
        for x1, x2 in zip(s,t):
            # Don't use 'or' is because if one in map, the other is not in map, we can reduce to elif condition
            if x1 not in st_map and x2 not in ts_map:
                st_map[x1] = x2
                ts_map[x2] = x1
                
            # .get() will return noe if specified key is not present
            elif st_map.get(x1) != x2 or ts_map.get(x2) != x1:

## 思路想法
1. Mistaken idea: Using two pointers for 2 strings respectively, each step it moves, we compare whether behavior at 2 pointers are the same, if not, false.
This method is wrong because it is only record the change pattern, doesn't consider the value of the position. The question require no 2 characters can map to
the same character.

2. Character Mapping with Dictionary: We can process both of strings from left to right. At each step, we take 1 charater at a time from the 2 strings and compare 
them. We can use dictionary to check whether the item is already exsitded before and whether it is use the previous value. 

Notice: "badc" -> "baba", if we only compare from 1 string, this case will return false. It's bidirectinal.

## Syntax
1. zip()
The zip() function returns a zip object, which is an iterator of tuples where the first item in each passed iterator is paired together, and then 
the second item in each passed iterator are paired together etc.

If the passed iterators have different lengths, the iterator with the least items decides the length of the new iterator.

```python
a = ("John", "Charles", "Mike")
b = ("Jenny", "Christy", "Monica", "Vicky")

x = zip(a, b)

#use the tuple() function to display a readable version of the result:

print(tuple(x))

(('John', 'Jenny'), ('Charles', 'Christy'), ('Mike', 'Monica'))
```
2. dictionary.get()

The Python dictionary get() method returns the value associated with a specific key. ... get()—method comes in: it returns the value for a specified 
key in a dictionary. This method will only return a value if the specified key is present in the dictionary, otherwise it will return None.
