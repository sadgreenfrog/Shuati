My Solution

```python
#-------------dp-----------------------------#
class Solution:
    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
        # Top-Down Memoization
        def backtrack(i, j): # s for i, j for p
            # base case
            if i >= len(s) and j >= len(p):
                return True
            if j >= len(p):
                return False
            # The first character of the string is matched
            match = i <= len(s) and (s[i] == p[j] or p[j] == ".") 
            # The first character of the pattern will not be the star
            if (j + 1) < len(p) and p[j+1] == "*":
                return (backtrack(i, j + 2) or  # don't use *，前一个不一样才跳到后2
                (match and backtrack(i+1,j))) # use *,前一个一样才能用*
            if match:
                return backtrack(i+1, j+1)
            return False
        return backtrack(0,0)

## 解题思路和想法
LRU:  Least recently used

It is a common strategy to rank the data with time series. The least recently used will be sit in cache, and once the storage is full and the new data coming in,
we can delete the data long no used. 

This question is actually require us to design a algorithm, we first accept a capacity as the max container. Then implement 2 API, put(key, value) to store and
update, get(key) to retrieve the corresponding val. 

From the question, we know the requirement needs the data has the sequence based on the time series. And we also need to get the data in O(1), so we can use 
a hashmap to store. For the put operation, we have "insert" to the head, "find the node" and update, "delete the node" and insert in O(1). So we can think about a
linked list.

sudo code
```python
def get(key):
  if key not in hashmap:
    return -1
  else:
    move node to the head
    return val
def put(key, val):
  newnode(key,val)
  if key in hashmap:
    delte the old node
    add newnode to the head
  else:
    if cache is full:
      delete last node
      delete key in map
    put the newnode to the head
    add key into map   
```
