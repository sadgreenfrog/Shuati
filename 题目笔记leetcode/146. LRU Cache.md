## 146. LRU Cache

My Solution

```python
class Node:
    # We need doubly linked list, so have to create node first
    def __init__(self, key = None, val = None):
        self.key = key
        self.val = val
        self.next = None
        self.prev = None
class LRUCache:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.hashmap = {}
        # Create 2 new node: head and tail
        self.head = Node()
        self.tail = Node()
        # Connect head and tail to form a linked list
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head
    
    def move_to_head(self,key):
        # Need seperate operation to simply code
        # Be aware node can put in hashmap
        node = self.hashmap[key]
        # Take care prev and next of node
        prevnode = node.prev
        nextnode = node.next
        prevnode.next = nextnode
        nextnode.prev = prevnode
        # Take care head and head.next
        node1 = self.head.next 
        self.head.next = node
        node.prev = self.head
        node.next = node1
        node1.prev = node
    
    def add_to_head(self, key, val):
        new = Node(key, val)
        # Have to update hashmap, or you will lose capacity
        self.hashmap[key] = new
        node1 = self.head.next
        new.prev = self.head
        self.head.next = new
        new.next = node1
        node1.prev = new

    def del_tail(self):
        lastnode = self.tail.prev
        # Have to delete one ele from hashmap
        self.hashmap.pop(lastnode.key)
        prevnode = lastnode.prev
        prevnode.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = prevnode
        return lastnode
        
        
        
    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key not in self.hashmap:
            return -1
        else:
            self.move_to_head(key)
            return self.hashmap[key].val
    
    def put(self, key: int, val: int) -> None:
        if key in self.hashmap:
            # Update val first
            self.hashmap[key].val = val
            self.move_to_head(key)
        else:
            if len(self.hashmap) >= self.capacity:
                self.del_tail()
            self.add_to_head(key, val)
      
```

## 解题思路和想法
LRU:  Least recently used

It is a common strategy to rank the data with time series. The least recently used will be sit in cache, and once the storage is full and the new data coming in,
we can delete the data long no used. 

This question is actually require us to design a algorithm, we first accept a capacity as the max container. Then implement 2 API, put(key, value) to store and
update, get(key) to retrieve the corresponding val. 

From the question, we know the requirement needs the data has the sequence based on the time series. And we also need to get the data in O(1), so we can use 
a hashmap to store. hashmap: {key: Node address}For the put operation, we have "insert" to the head, "find the node" and update, "delete the node" and insert in O(1). So we can think about a linked list.

sudo code
```python
def get(key):
  if key not in hashmap:
    return -1
  else:
    move node to the head
    return val
def put(key, val):
  if key in hashmap:
    update the val
    move the head
  else:
    if cache is full:
      delete last node
      delete key in map
    put the newnode to the head
    add key into map   
```
## Syntax

dictionary.get(key,value): 

keyname	Required. The keyname of the item you want to return the value from 
value Optional. A value to return if the specified key does not exist. Default value None
