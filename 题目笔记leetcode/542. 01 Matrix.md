## 思路想法
DFS: It's a brute force method which time complexity is (mn)^2. When we meet 1, we will perform dfs to count the distance and take the minmum path. It's super
time cost because every time we meet 1, we will go to 4 directions around '1', find the distance of 4 directions and find the shorest path.

Native BFS: Looking over the entire matrix appears wasteful, we can try to replace BFS to DFS. Because the first time we meet 0 will be the shorest distance from
'1' to '0', that is the property of BFS. But it still has high complexity because there are lots of duplicated calculation.

Improved BFS: We start BFS from 0 and updating all the 1's in the path. The blank which is being filled first is always be the shortest path. Because the bfs
from 0 will give us the shorest distance once we meet -1 and update it with the value. Then we will put the blank which has value into que and take it as next level.
