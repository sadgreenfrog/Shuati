My Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution(object):
    def generateTrees(self, n):
        if n == 0: return []
        return self.helper(1, n)    
    def helper(self, start, end):
        if start > end:
            return [None]
        all_trees = []
        for rootval in range(start, end+1):
            left_tree = self.helper(start, rootval-1)
            right_tree = self.helper(rootval+1, end)
            # This part is to append all the trees into path
            for left_subtree in left_tree:
                for right_subtree in right_tree:
                    curroot = TreeNode(rootval)
                    curroot.left = left_subtree
                    curroot.right = right_subtree
                    # curroot is now the root of a BST
                    all_trees.append(curroot)
        return all_trees
```
## 解题思路
Let's pick up number i out of the sequence 1...n and use it as the root of the current tree. There are i-1 elements available for the construction of the
left subtrss and n-i avaiable for the right subtree.

```python
class Solution:
    def generateTrees(self, n: int) -> List[Optional[TreeNode]]:
        
        def rec(l, r):
            # Termination
            if l > r:
                return [None]
            # Single layer 
            all_trees = []
            for i in range(l, r+1):
                # Recursivly get list of left and right subtrees
                left = rec(l, i-1)
                right = rec(i+1, r)
                for left_tree in left:
                    for right_tree in right:
                        curnode = TreeNode(i)
                        curnode.left = left_tree
                        curnode.right = right_tree
                        all_trees.append(curnode)
            return all_trees
        
        if n == 0: return []
        return rec(1,n)
```
Thinking steps:

1. The goal is to create every possible BST that contain numbers [1, n]. To do this, we can iterate through [1, n] to create a root node. 

2. Next step, we can try to do the same to the children of current rootnode, but we have to obey the rule that nodes in a left subtree must
be less than root, nodes in a right subtree must be greater than the root. So we can't directly iterate through [1, n]. So for left the section
can be [1, curroot], for the right the section can be [current+1, n]
```python
            for i in range(l, r+1):
                curnode = TreeNode(i)
                left = rec(l, i-1)
                right = rec(i+1, r)
                curnode.left = left
                curnode.right = right
```

3. In the surface, it's already enough to go through all the possible place of nodes. But we also need to consider the combination of left nodes 
and right nodes. And don't forget to add None in the list, or it will lose the combination of none element branch and the other side.
