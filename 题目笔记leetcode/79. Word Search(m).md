My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def exist(self, board, word):
        # check 上下左右四个维度, if 有 move to that one and iterate again.
        # 终止条件: if len[path] == len[word], 全部找完 / not match, return
        # 单层逻辑: list[i][j], check  L[i-1][j],L[i+1][j],L[i][j-1],L[i][j+1]

        node = []
        # find the node
        for i in range(len(board)):
            count = []
            for j in range(len(board[i])):
                if board[i][j] == word[0]:  # 如果找到了node,开始dfs
                    count.extend([i,j])
                else:
                    continue  # 继续找
            if count:
                node.append(count)
        # backtrack
        path =[]
        path.append(word[0])

        def backtrack(board, word, i,j,q,path):
            m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
            if len(path) == len(word):
                return
                return True
            if board[i - 1][j] == word[q] and 0 < i:  # up
                path.append(word[q])
                backtrack(board, word, i-1, j, q+1, path)
                path.pop()

            elif board[i + 1][j] == word[q] and i < m-1:  # down,真是见鬼了
                path.append(word[q])
                backtrack(board, word, i+1, j, q+1, path)
                path.pop()
            elif board[i][j - 1] == word[q] and j > 0:  # left
                path.append(word[q])
                backtrack(board, word, i, j-1, q+1, path)
                path.pop()

            elif board[i][j + 1] == word[q] and j < n -1:  # right
                path.append(word[q])
                backtrack(board, word, i, j+1, q+1, path)
                path.pop()
            return False

        # 先遍历node,再遍历矩阵里面dfs
        for i, j in node:
            for q in range(1,len(word)):
                backtrack(board, word, i, j, q, path)
```
## 解题思路
Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching 
tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root node (selecting 
some arbitrary node as the root node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

The basic idea is to start from the root or any arbitrary node and mark the node and move to the adjacent unmarked node and continue 
this loop until there is no unmarked adjacent node

单层逻辑: 上下左右找路径, 找到就加入到path
终止条件: 找到就退出
