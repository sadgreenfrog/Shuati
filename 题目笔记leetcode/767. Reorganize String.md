## 767. Reorganize String

https://leetcode.com/problems/reorganize-string/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reorganizeString(self, s: str) -> str:

        # Count the orrance of char and check the possiblity
        if len(s) < 2:
            return s
        
        length = len(s)
        counts = defaultdict(int)
        for x in s:
            counts[x] += 1
            
        maxheap = []
        res = []
        for char, num in counts.items():
            if num > (length+1) // 2:
                return ""
            maxheap.append((-num, char))
        heapq.heapify(maxheap)
        
        # Put the counts into heap and pop
        while len(maxheap) > 1:
            
            _, letter1 = heapq.heappop(maxheap)
            _, letter2 = heapq.heappop(maxheap)
            res.append(letter1)
            res.append(letter2)
            counts[letter1] -= 1
            counts[letter2] -= 1
            if counts[letter1] > 0:
                heapq.heappush(maxheap, (-counts[letter1], letter1))
            if counts[letter2] > 0:
                heapq.heappush(maxheap, (-counts[letter2], letter2))
        if maxheap:
            res.append(maxheap[-1][1])
        
        return "".join(res)
```

## 解题思路和想法
When we rearrange the stings, we need to handle char position based on the occurance of char. If the occurance number of some char larger than (length+1)//2. then
it is not possible two adjacent char are not the same. So we can iterate the string and calculate the occurance of each char, char as the key, occurance as the 
value.
Then after we check the possiblity. We can throw the hashmap into heap and pop out the largest ocurrance char and append it into the res. 
Be notice, if there is only one element in maxheap, we can not pop out 2. So need to check maxheap after the while loop.

## Syntax
1. How to sort a dictionary by it's value? (defaultdict(int) or Counter())
```python
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> x = Counter({'a':5, 'b':3, 'c':7})
>>> sorted(x)
['a', 'b', 'c']
>>> sorted(x.items())
[('a', 5), ('b', 3), ('c', 7)]
>>> [(l,k) for k,l in sorted([(j,i) for i,j in x.items()])]
[('b', 3), ('a', 5), ('c', 7)]
>>> [(l,k) for k,l in sorted([(j,i) for i,j in x.items()], reverse=True)]
[('c', 7), ('a', 5), ('b', 3)
```
Or:
```python
>>> from collections import Counter
>>> x = Counter({'a':5, 'b':3, 'c':7})
>>> x.most_common()
[('c', 7), ('a', 5), ('b', 3)]
```
It'll do so in the most efficient manner possible; if you ask for a Top N instead of all values, a heapq is used instead of a straight sort.

Outside of counters, sorting can always be adjusted based on a key function; .sort() and sorted() both take callable that lets you specify a 
value on which to sort the input sequence; sorted(x, key=x.get, reverse=True) would give you the same sorting as x.most_common(), but only return the keys,
for example:
```python
>>> sorted(x, key=x.get, reverse=True)
['c', 'a', 'b']
```
or you can sort on only the value given (key, value) pairs:
```python
>>> sorted(x.items(), key=lambda pair: pair[1], reverse=True)
[('c', 7), ('a', 5), ('b', 3)]
```
