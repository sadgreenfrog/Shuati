https://leetcode.com/problems/nim-game/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def canWinNim(self, n):
        # dp[]: whether True or false
        # dp[i] = dp[i-1] and dp[i-2] and dp[i-3] if there is a true it is true
        # Base case: 1, 2, 3, True
        dp = [False for _ in range(n+1)]
        if n <= 3: return True
        dp[1] = dp[2] = dp[3] = True
        for i in range(4, n+1):
            if dp[i-1] & dp[i-2] & dp[i-3] == True:
                dp[i] = False
            else:
                dp[i] = True
        return dp[n]
```

## 思路想法
DP solution: Each step we can take 1-3 stone. It's my turn, the previous situition is my friend may take 1 stone, 2 stone, 3 stone. If the previous 3 situiation can
all be achieved by friend, then you don't have the chance to achive it, it's false.
