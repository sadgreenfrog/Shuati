My Solution

```python
#---------------------DFS, (mn)^2--------------------------#
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:

        # DFS to find the shorest route to gate
        m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        def dfs(rooms, i, j, count):
            # Start explore, up, down, left, right
            direction = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]
            for d in range(4):
                newi, newj = i + direction[d][0], j + direction[d][1]
                if 0 <= newi <= m-1 and 0 <= newj <= n-1 and rooms[newi][newj] != -1 and count < rooms[newi][newj]:
                    rooms[newi][newj] = count
                    dfs(rooms, newi, newj, count+1)
                
        if m == 0: return
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                
                    dfs(rooms, i, j, 1)
#--------------------BFS, (mn)---------------------------#
class Solution:
    def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:

        # BFS to find the shorest route to gate
        m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
        if m == 0: return
        que = []
        # Find all gates

                if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                    que.append((i,j))
                    
        # Do bfs
        visited = set()
        while que:
            row, col = que.pop(0)
            direction = [[-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1]]
            for d in range(4):
                newr, newc = row + direction[d][0], col + direction[d][1]
                if 0 <= newr <= m-1 and 0 <= newc <= n-1 and rooms[newr][newc] == 2147483647 and (newr, newc) not in visited:
                    visited.add((newr, newc))
                    rooms[newr][newc] = rooms[row][col] + 1
                    que.append((newr,newc))

## 解题思路

1. Using 2 for loops to iterate through the matrix and amnd find all the gates, from each gates, we perform dfs to scan all the possible count,
if current count < preious, update it. In worse case,

2. O(mn) time complexity, the reason we just has one power of mn is because bfs weill always give you the shortest way way to a target. When you
get a target first, it will be the least count, so we put that intoo visited, next time we don't need to visit it again.

If we want to know a path exists between two nodes, use DFS.
If we want to calculate shortest path between two nodes, use BFS.
