19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        # Traverse twice, once for get Length, another one is to find the node
        if not head: return head
        count = 0
        dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        cur = head
        while cur:
            cur = cur.next
            count += 1
        pos = count - n
        cur = dummy
        # Please note here we should start with dummy, because if head is the one we should delete, it will not go into the for loop.
        for i in range(pos):
             cur = cur.next
        cur.next = cur.next.next
        return dummy.next
#---------------------------2 pointers---------------------------------------#
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: Optional[ListNode], n: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        dummy = ListNode(next = head)
        node1 = head
        node2 = dummy
        for i in range(n):
            node1 = node1.next
        while node1:
            node1 = node1.next
            node2 = node2.next
        # Be be be attention here, noed2 have to start from dummy!! There is a situation to delete from head.
        node2.next = node2.next.next
        return dummy.next     
```
## 解题思路
方法1: 遍历两次linked list, 一次得到长度，下一次在长度-n+1时候，把指针指向下下一个。

方法2:不预处理出链表的长度，以及使用常数空间的前提下，可以用两个指针，中间相隔n个节点。当第一个遍历到末尾时，第二个遍历到离尾巴n个节点。The above algorithm could be optimized to one
pass. Instead of one pointer, we could use 2 pointers. The first pointer advances the list by n+1 steps from the beginning, while the second pointer starts from 
the beginning of the list. Now both pointers are sperated by n nodes, it means when the 1st node arrives the end. The second pointer will be pointing at the nth node from the last.
