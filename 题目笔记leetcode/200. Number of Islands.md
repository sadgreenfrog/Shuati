My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    
    # Search for 1
    def dfs(self, grid, r, c):
        # Base case: row, col
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        
        if c < 0 or r < 0 or c >= col or r >= row or grid[r][c] == "0":
            return
        else:
            grid[r][c] = "0"
            self.dfs(grid, r, c-1)
            self.dfs(grid, r, c+1)
            self.dfs(grid, r-1, c)
            self.dfs(grid, r+1, c)
        
    def numIslands(self, grid):
        num_of_island = 0
        row, col = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                if grid[i][j] == "1":
                    num_of_island += 1
                    self.dfs(grid, i, j)
        return num_of_island            
```
## 思路想法
1. DFS to search through the 2-d matrix, if a node contains a '1', then it is the root node that triggers a DFS. During DFS, every visited node should be set
as '0' to mark as visted node. Then count the number of root nodes that trigger DFS, this number would be the number of islands since each DFS start at some root identifiers
an island.

    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        count = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == '1':
                    count += 1
                    grid[i][j] = 'x'
                    que = [(i, j)]
                    while que:
                        x, y = que.pop(0)
                        for d in [[0,1],[0,-1],[-1,0],[1,0]]:
                            newx, newy = x + d[0], y + d[1]
                            if 0 <= newx < m and 0 <= newy < n and grid[newx][newy] == '1':
                                grid[newx][newy] = 'x'
                                que.append((newx,newy))
        return count
            
```
Ususally using queue to insert the nodes then pop from the left to get the next LEVEL.

If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree, a breadth first search (BFS) might be better.

If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare, depth first search (DFS) might take an extremely long time, but BFS could be faster.

If the tree is very wide, a BFS might need too much memory, so it might be completely impractical.

If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree, BFS could be impractical.

If the search tree is very deep you will need to restrict the search depth for depth first search (DFS), anyway (for example with iterative deepening).
