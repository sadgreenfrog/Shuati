## 
21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/

My Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode() # avoid edge case
        tail = dummy
        # iterate through these 2 lists
        while l1 and l2:
            if l1.val < l2.val:
                tail.next = l1 # tail指向l1 node
                l1 = l1.next # 相当于i++
            else:
                tail.next = l2
                l2 = l2.next
            tail = tail.next # tail node going to be updated regardless of which node we insert into our list
            # 之前只是指定了tail的next是谁，这一步是为了让尾巴更新，tail = tail.next
        # 出现condition,一个已经遍历空了
            if l1:
                tail.next = l1
            if l2:
                tail.next = l2
        return dummy.next # dummy指的是第一个?
```

## 思路想法
Considering two different sorted list, now we need to combine them together, how to do that?

Compare the first element in the list, because they are definitively the smallest elements in each of the list.

Whichever element smaller we want to put that into a new list and we ignor it, then move whichever pointer forward in the list and compare the

element in the other list. And once we don't have 2 elements to compare, maybe still left one list, we have to figure out which one we haven't

gone through and add to the list.
