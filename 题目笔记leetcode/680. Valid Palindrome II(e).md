## 680. Valid Palindrome II
https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome-ii/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def validPalindrome(self, s):
        # Time complexity: O(n)
        # special case, len = 1
        if len(s) == 1: return True
        # 2 pointers go through the string
        left, right = 0, len(s)-1
        while left <= right:
        # mismatch: s[left+1, right] or s[left, right-1]
            if s[left] != s[right]:
                delete_left = s[left+1:right+1]
                delete_right = s[left: right]
                return delete_left == delete_left[::-1] or delete_right == delete_right[::-1]
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True
```

## 解题思路和想法
Intuitive thought: We can use 2-pointers that start at the left and right of the string and move forwards when they are match. Whenever there is a mismatch, we can
either exclude the character at the left or the right pointer. Then we can take 2 remaining substrings and compare against its reversed and see either of it is a 
palindrome.
