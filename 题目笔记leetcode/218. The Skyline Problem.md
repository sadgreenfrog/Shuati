## 解题思路

The intuitive methond is to initialize skyline as an empty srting, then one by one add builfings to skyline. A building is added by first finding
the overlapping strip. If not strip then directly add. If there is, the the height of the  existing strip may increase. It would be n^2 time consume.

DC solution: Similar to Merge Sort, divide the given buildings in two subsets. Recursively construct skyline for 2 halves and finally merge the two
skylines.
