My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def isAlienSorted(self, words, order):
        """
        :type words: List[str]
        :type order: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        # if just one word: return true
        if len(words) == 1: return True
        # Uing dictionary to label the index
        order_map = {}
        for index, val in enumerate(order):
            order_map[val] = index
        # compare the char of the items in words until find the first different char if true, go to next words.  
        for i in range(len(words)-1): # Because we need to compare with words[i+1]
            for j in range(len(words[i])):
                # ["apple",'app'] if previous word's length larger than latter one, false
                if j >= len(words[i+1]): return False 
                
                if words[i][j] != words[i+1][j]:
                    if order_map[words[i][j]] > order_map[words[i+1][j]]:
                        return False
                    else: # Go to the next j
                        break
        return True

```

## 解题思路和想法
1. Brute Force: The question can be seen as to compare each pair of adjacent words lexicographically. We want to find the first letter that is different. If the first
different leeft of words[i] < words[i+1], we want to find the first letter that is different.

break 跳出离此break最近的循环

continue 终止离此continue最近的循环的当前一次循环，但不跳出，仍在该循环继续执行
