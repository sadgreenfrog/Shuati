133. Clone Graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def cloneGraph(self, node):

        if not node: return None
        
        clone = {}
        def dfs(node):
            if node in clone:
                return clone[node]
            copy = Node(node.val, [])
            clone[node] = copy
            for nei in node.neighbors:
                copy.neighbors.append(dfs(nei))
        
            return copy
        
        return dfs(node)
```

## 思路想法

The intuition for the problem is to copy as we iterate through the nodes' neighbors. It means we are dealing with a graph because 
each node could have many neighbors. We can use DFS to scan over the whole graph, each node might be the neighbor of previous node and 
each node will have many neighbors. The only thing worth to notice is that we don't want to stuck in a cycle while we are traversing
the graph.
