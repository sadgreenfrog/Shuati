215. Kth Largest Element in an Array

https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findKthLargest(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # k largetest means kth from the back
        minheap = []
        
        for x in nums:
            
            heapq.heappush(minheap, x)
            if len(minheap) > k:
                heapq.heappop(minheap)
        
        return heapq.heappop(minheap)
```
## 解题思路
Kth Largest element in array means the kth smallest element from the end. So we can think of using a minheap to pop out the small element until len(minheap) > k,
then the next one would be the answer. The time complexity of adding an element in a heap of size k is O(logk), and we do it N times that means O(Nlogk) 
time complexity for the algorithm.
