## 
171. Excel Sheet Column Number

https://leetcode.com/problems/excel-sheet-column-number/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def titleToNumber(self, columnTitle):
        capitals = [chr(_) for _ in range(ord('A'), ord('Z')+1)]
        # if we use char to find the index remember to + 1
        res = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(columnTitle):
            res = res*26 + (capitals.index(x)+1)
        return res
```

## 思路想法
1. Transfer the character from A to Z to the intergers that represents the char into a list. A-Z indeicate the index 0-25.
Then, it is the revserd process of 168

## Syntax
ord(): Return the integer that represents the character "h"

chr(): Get the character that represents the unicode 97
