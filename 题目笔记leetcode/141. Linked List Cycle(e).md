## Linked List Cycle

https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/

My Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        seen = set()
        while head:
            if head in seen:
                return True
            seen.add(head)
            head = head.next
        return False
```

## 解题思路和想法

head只是1,2,3,4,5... head.val才是里面放的数值。

## Syntax Notes
set()函数创建一个无序不重复元素集，可进行关系测试，删除重复数据，可以计算交集并集。

8.26:
We can use hash map to find the duplicates in list. 2-pointer tech is also useful and efficient to solve this problem.

Imagine there are 2 runners with different speed. If they are running on a straight path, the fast runner will first arrive at the destination. However, if they
are running on a circle track, the fast runner will catch up with the slow runner if they keep running.
```python
# Two pointers
class Solution(object):
    def hasCycle(self, head):
        low = head
        fast = head
        while fast and fast.next:
            low = low.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if low == fast:
                return True
        return False
```
