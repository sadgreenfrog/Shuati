My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def mostVisitedPattern(self, username: List[str], timestamp: List[int], website: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        if len(username) == 3: return username
        # Use list as the defaultdict factory
        user_tuple = defaultdict(list)
        # first zip these 3 users and sorted 
        for u, t, w in sorted(zip(username, timestamp, website), key = lambda x: (x[0],x[1])):
            # Defaultdict can directly append 
            user_tuple[u].append(w) 
        
        patterns = Counter()
        for u, w in user_tuple.items():
            # Do the combination in 3 itmes in websites
            three_sequence = combinations(w, 3) 
            # avoid counting repeats in one users
            three_sequence = set(three_sequence)
            # Convert to dictionaty of counts
            three_sequence = Counter(three_sequence)
            # Count and update the number of most used websites
            patterns.update(three_sequence)
            
        return max(sorted(patterns), key = patterns.get)
```

More on this question is about familar how to use package in python, lots of operation we don't need to implement ourselves.

## Syntax:
1. Itertools.combinations(iterable, r): It return r-length tuples in sorted order with no repeated elements. 
[1, 2, 3, 4] -> [1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,3],[2,4],[3,4]

2. Counter[Iterable-or-mapping]: is a dict subclass for counting hashtable objects. It is a collection where elements are stored as dictionary key and their
counts are stored as dictionary values. 

3. 
list.sort() is only defined for lists.
sorted() accepts any iterable.

A common pattern is to sert complex objects using some of the object's indices as keys.
```python
student_tuples = [('john','a','15'), ('marry','b','12'),('dizzy','c','10')]
sorted(student_tuples, key = lambda x: x[2])
[('dizzy','c','10'),('marry','b','12'),('john','a','15')]
```
Both list.sort() and sorted() accept a reverse parameter with a boolean value, reverse = True.

4.
DefaultDict: using list as default_factory, when the list class is passed as the default_factory argument, then a defaultdict is created
with the values that are list.

5. 
Counter is a subclass of dict that's specially designed for counting hashtable objects in python. It's a dictionary that stores objects as keys
and counts as values. To count with Counter, you typically provide a sequence or iterable of hashtable objects as an argument to the class's constructor.
```python
from collections import Counter
Counter("mississippi")
# -> {'i':4, 's':4, 'p':2, 'm':1}
```
Counter iterates over "mississippi" and produces a dictionary with the letters as keys and their frequency as values.
