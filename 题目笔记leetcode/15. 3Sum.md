## Three Sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/

My Solution

```python
错误:
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        hashtable = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            hashtable[num] = i
        for x in nums:
            if target - x in nums:
                return [hashtable[target-x], hashtable[x]]
        return []
正确:
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        hashtable = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            hashtable[num] = i
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if target - x in nums and i != hashtable[target-x]:
                return [hashtable[target-x], i]
        return []
```

## 思路想法

This question can be grown from 2sum and 2sum2, 2 pointers and hashmap.

For 2 pointers:
Sort it first to make it in sequence: reduce duplicates & 2 pointers. Iterate through the nums as index i, and select nums[i] as the pivot element, 
then we can use 2 pointers technology of the elements behind of it.
