My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def cleanRoom(self, robot):
        def go_back():
            robot.turnRight()
            robot.turnRight()
            robot.move()
            robot.turnRight()
            robot.turnRight()
            
        def backtrack(cell = (0,0), d = 0):
            visited.add(cell)
            robot.clean()
            # Going through clockwise: 0:'up', 1:'right',2:'down', 3:'left', be aware it's based on the original directions!!!
            directions = [(-1, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1)]
            for i in range(4):
                new_d = (d + i) % 4
                new_cell = (cell[0] + directions[new_d][0], cell[1] + directions[new_d][1])
                if not new_cell in visited and robot.move():
                    backtrack(new_cell, new_d)
                    #go_back()
                # Make the new cell clockwise
                robot.turnRight()
            go_back()
                
        visited = set()
        backtrack()
```
## 解题思路

2 Concepts needed for this question.

1. Constrained programming: This means to put restrictions/take notes after each robot moves, marked as visited. Then the robot don't need to be back
again unless necessarily needed. That propagates constraints and helps to reduce the number of combinations to consider.
2. Backtracking: When the robot can not go further, for example around by obstacle or visited. But the several steps before, there was a cell which
proposed have another way to go. That means we need to come back to that cell and explore alternate path.
