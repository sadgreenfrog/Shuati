234. Palindrome Linked List

My Solution

```python
#---------------Array method-------------#
# T:O(n) S:O(n)
class Solution(object):
    def isPalindrome(self, head):
        nodelist = []
        while head:
            nodelist.append(head.val)
            head = head.next
        return nodelist == nodelist[::-1]
#----------------Reverse + Findhalf-----------------#
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        # T: O(n), S: O(1)
        # Find the half node
        # Reverse the second part
        # Put the second part behind the first part
        # Compare from the head and middle
        if not head: return True
        halfnode = self.findhalf(head)
        part2_head = self.reverse(halfnode.next)
        part1 = head
        part2 = part2_head
        while part1 and part2:
            if part1.val != part2.val:
                return False
            part1 = part1.next
            part2 = part2.next
        return True 
    def reverse(self, node):
        # 3->4<-5
        if not node or not node.next:
            return node
        p = self.reverse(node.next)
        node.next.next = node
        node.next = None
        return p
    # I need the previous node before half
    def findhalf(self, head):
        slow = head
        fast = head
        while fast.next and fast.next.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
        return slow
    
```
## 解题思路
1. Array method: very intuitive. Iterate through the linked list to put cal of each node into array.

2. In an attempt to come up with a way of using O(1) space, we can think of using recursion. We can iterate the nodes in reverse using recursion, and iterate 
forward at the same time using a variable outside the recursive function, then we can check whether or not we have a palindrome. 绝妙

3. The only way we can avoid using O(n) extra space is by modifying the input in-place. The strategy we can use is to reverse the second half of the linked List
in-place, and then compare the part1 and part 2 respectively.
Be notice: When we find halfnode, we have to find the previous one from the middle, not the middle one.
