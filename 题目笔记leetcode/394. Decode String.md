My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def decodeString(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for x in s:
            if x == ']':
                string = ''
                # Get the single string
                while stack[-1] != '[':
                    string += stack.pop()
                #Get the whole string
                stack.pop()
                string = string[::-1]
                # Get the number
                k = 0
                base = 1
                while stack and stack[-1].isnumeric():
                    k += int(stack.pop()) * base
                    base *= 10
                i = 0
                while i < int(k):
                    for y in string:
                        stack.append(y)
                    i += 1
            else:
                stack.append(x)
        return ''.join(stack)
```

## 思路想法

We have to decode the result in a particular pattern. If we meet a number n, we are going to duplicate n times for latter string in []. 
So how to extract the string in open '[' and the close ']' and duplicate them is the key. 

We can push each character to the stack until is not a closing ]. Once we encounter the closing bracket. we can start top decoding the string,
which is pop from the stack until meet [. Then we continue pop out the decode number of the substring until the non-numeraical charactors.
Now we have number and string, we decode them and push back to stack and continue iterating.
