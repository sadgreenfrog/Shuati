My Solution

```python
#---------------------DFS--------------------------#
class Solution:
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        
        num = len(rooms)-1        
        visited = set()     
        def dfs(head, visited):     
            key = rooms[head]
            for x in key:
                if x not in visited:
                    visited.add(x)
                    dfs(x, visited)    
        visited = set()
        visited.add(0)
        dfs(0, visited)
        for i in range(len(rooms)):
            if i not in visited:
                return False
        return True
        
#-----------------Stack----------------------------#
class Solution(object):
    def canVisitAllRooms(self, rooms):
        stack = [0]
        visited = [0]
        while stack:
            room = stack.pop()
            keys = rooms[room]
            for x in keys:
                if x not in visited:
                    visited.append(x)
                    stack.append(x)
        for i in range(len(rooms)):
            if i not in visited:
                return False
        return True
```

## 思路想法
The question ask the room we can't visit, so it's relatively straight forward to iterate, put the visited node into a list and then 
check whether it's full or missed rooms.
