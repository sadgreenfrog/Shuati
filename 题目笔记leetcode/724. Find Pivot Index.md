## Find Pivot Index

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-pivot-index/

My Solution

```python
class Solution(object):
    def pivotIndex(self, nums):
        S = sum(nums)
        leftsum = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            if leftsum == S-x-leftsum:
                return i
            leftsum += x
        return -1

```

## 思路想法

We need to quickly compute the sum of values to the left and the right of every index.

We can set a variable for leftsum, then the rightsum would be Stotal - x(current) - leftsum. If left == right, then return index.

I am using 2 pointers first, then I find I can't handle the situation the index == 0.
