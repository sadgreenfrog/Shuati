        largest, second = 0, 0
        idx = 0
        for i, x in enumerate(nums):
            
            if x >= largest:
                second = largest
                largest = x
                idx = i
            
            elif x > second:
                second = x
        
        if largest >= second * 2:
            return idx
        
        return -1
