My Solution

```python
#-----------------Native Backtrack, O(2^n), exceed time-----------------#
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
                # DFS to iterate through all the possible solution + backtrack
        count = 0
        def dfs(cursum, index):
            if cursum == target and index == len(nums):
                return 1
            if index == len(nums):
                return 0
            # + first / - second
            count = dfs(cursum + nums[index], index+1) + dfs(cursum - nums[index], index+1)
            return count
        return dfs(0, 0)
#-------------------+ Memo-----------------------#
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
                # DFS to iterate through all the possible solution + backtrack
        count = 0
        memo = {}
        def dfs(cursum, index):
            if (index, cursum) in memo:
                return memo[(index, cursum)]
            if cursum == target and index == len(nums):
                return 1
            if index == len(nums):
                return 0
            # + first / - second
            count = dfs(cursum + nums[index], index+1) + dfs(cursum - nums[index], index+1)
            memo[(index, cursum)] = count
            return count
        
        return dfs(0, 0)
```

## 思路想法

1. Backtrack: The intuitive way to solve this problem is to try both + and - symbols at every location in the givin array and
add the count once we touch the base. Notice that as a passed value, cursum will keep the same value in each level. It means,
when we traverse through + and touch -, cursum is still the same value before  +.

2. + Memo

In order to remove this redundancy, we make use of memoization as well to store the results which have been calculated earlier.

## Syntax

Python is a pass by object reference language. The variable and the value of the variable (the object) are two seperate things.
The variable 'points to' the object. The variable is not the object.

e.g. x = [], []is the empty list, x is a variable that points to the empty list, but x itself is not the empty list. The value
of [] is the object.

```python
def append_one(li):
    li.append(1)
x = [0]
append_one(x)
print x

Output => [0,1]
```
Here, the statement x = [0] makes a variable x (box) that points towards the object [0]. On the function being called, a new 
box li is created. The contents of li are the SAME as the contents of the box x. Both the boxes contain the same object. 
That is, both the variables point to the same object in memory. Hence, any change to the object pointed at by li will also be 
reflected by the object pointed at by x.

```python
def append_one(li):
    li = [0, 1]
x = [0]
append_one(x)
print x

output => [0]
```
If the variable li is reassigned in the function, then li will point to a separate object in memory. x however, 
will continue pointing to the same object in memory it was pointing to earlier.

为了决定是「pass by value」还是「pass by reference」，有两条简单的规则：

如果想要函数返回一个单值，用「pass by value, 记得return才可以改变原来的值。
如果想要函数返回两个或更多的值，用「pass by reference」
