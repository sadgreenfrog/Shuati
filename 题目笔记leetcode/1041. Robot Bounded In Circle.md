## 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle

https://leetcode.com/problems/robot-bounded-in-circle/

My solution:

```python
class Solution:
    def isRobotBounded(self, instructions: str) -> bool:
        index = 0
        # Notrh, west, sorth, east
        directions = [[1,0],[0,1],[-1,0],[0,-1]]
        x, y = 0, 0
        for i in instructions:
            if i == "L":
                index = (index + 1) % 4
            elif i == "R":
                index = (index + 3) % 4
            else:
                x += directions[index][0]
                y += directions[index][1]
        return (x == 0 and y == 0) or index != 0             
```

## 解题思路和想法
We actually just need to run 1 cycle to identify the limit cycle trajectory. 

1. If the robot returns to the initial point afer one cycle, that's limit cycle trajectory.
2. If tobot doesn't face north at the end of cycle, that's the limit cycle trajectory.
