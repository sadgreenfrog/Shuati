My solution:

```python
class Solution(object):
    def findOrder(self, numCourses, prerequisites):
        """
        :type numCourses: int
        :type prerequisites: List[List[int]]
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        prereq = {c: [] for c in range(numCourses)}
        for crs, pre in prerequisites:
            prereq[crs].append(pre)
            
        # eachcourse has 3 possible states:
        
        # visited -> crs has been added to output, don't need to consider
        # visiting -> crs not added to output, but added to cycle
        # unvisited -> crs not added to output or cycle
        
        output = []
        visit, cycle = set(), set()
        
        def dfs(crs):
            if crs in cycle:
                return False # Means it is a one directed cycle, can not finished
            if crs in visit:
                return True # It's already in the path, stop here
            cycle.add(crs)
            for pre in prereq[crs]:
                if dfs(pre) == False:
                    return False
            cycle.remove(crs)
            visit.add(crs)

Topology sorting:

Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge u v, vertex u comes before v in the 
ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

We recommend to first see the implementation of DFS. We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it 
and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack.
We don’t print the vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print 
contents of the stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the 
stack.
