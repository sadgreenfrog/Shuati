1051. Height Checker

https://leetcode.com/problems/height-checker/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def heightChecker(self, heights: List[int]) -> int:
        
        maxval = max(heights)
        # Frequency array
        fre = [0] * (maxval+1)
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            cur = heights[i]
            fre[cur] += 1
        print(fre)
        # Transfer frequency to sumcount
        sumcount = [0] * (maxval + 1)
        for i in range(1, maxval+1):
            sumcount[i] = fre[i] + sumcount[i-1]
        print(sumcount)
        # Transfer sumcount into sorted array
        output = [0] * len(heights)
        for i in range(len(heights)-1, -1, -1):
            element = heights[i]
            index = sumcount[element]-1
            output[index] = element
            sumcount[element] -= 1 
        print(output)
        # Compare the differences
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(heights)):
            if output[i] != heights[i]:
                count += 1
        return count
```

## 思路想法

Counting Sort: 计数排序

Can be done in O(n) time,

Step:

1. Create a frequency array and iterate through a for loop to get count for each element.

2. Create a sumcount array by adding current element + prior element. This step is to calculate the sorted "index" of the elements. Be notice to 
reduce one because of 0 based index.

3. Translate sumcount array into sorted array. Expand the length from frequency to origin.
