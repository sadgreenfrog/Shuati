## 61. Rotate List

https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/

My Solution

```python
#---------------------------Brute Force----------------------#
class Solution:
    def rotateRight(self, head: Optional[ListNode], k: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # Get the length of the Linked list, count
        if k == 0 or not head or not head.next: return head
        count = 1
        cur = head
        while cur.next:
            cur = cur.next
            count += 1
        # Compare the count and k
        if count == k:
            return head
        if count < k:
            k = k % count
            if k == 0:
                return head
        # Rotate the linked list 
        # start at count-k+1
        cur1 = head
        # 一定要保证.next的时候一定有next!
        for i in range(count-k-1):
            cur1 = cur1.next
        # Restore the real cur1.next, which is 3.next = 4
        cur2 = cur1.next
        cur1.next = None # cur1 at 3
        head_new = cur2
        dummynode = ListNode()
        dummynode.next = head_new # cur2 = 4
        for i in range(k-1):
            cur2 = cur2.next
        cur2.next = head
        return dummynode.next
 #--------------------Close the loop-----------------------------#
 class Solution(object):
    def rotateRight(self, head, k):
        if not head: return head
        # get length
        length, tail = 1, head # head is not null
        while tail.next:
            tail = tail.next
            length += 1
        k = k % length
        if k == 0:
            return head
        # Move to the pivot and rotate
        cur = head
        for i in range(length - k -1):
            cur = cur.next
        newHead = cur.next 
        cur.next = None
        tail.next = head # Close the loop
        return newHead
 
```
## 思路方法
1. 暴力解法： Traverse the linkedlist to get the length of the list, count. Then compare the count with k, if count == k, return head directly, if count < k, we need
to subtract count from k until k <= count. Next step is to seperate the last k element and first count-k elements. Here I am using 2 for to get these 2 lists, which 
is not efficient. Lots of edge cases need to be considered and lots of temporary variable need to be set. Attention!!! Can not directly operate on the head if you
are going to use it latter.

2. 闭合为环
We take the input linked list and we take the last k nodes whatever k is and we are going to break the linked list at that point. Then swap these 2 parts.
