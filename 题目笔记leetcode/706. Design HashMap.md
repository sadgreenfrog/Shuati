https://leetcode.com/problems/design-hashmap/

My Solution

```python
class MyHashMap:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.max = 2069
        self.arr = [[] for _ in range(2069)]
    
    def get_hash(self, key):
        # Define hash function
        hashsum = 0
        for char in str(key):
            hashsum += ord(char)
        return hashsum % self.max
    
    # Remember need to diffenciate the situation. 1st alrady in array(update), 2nd not in array
    def put(self, key, value):
        keyindex = self.get_hash(key)
        found = False # Find found flag
        for idx, element in enumerate(self.arr[keyindex]):
            if element[0] == key:
                self.arr[keyindex][idx] = (key, value)
                found = True
                break
        if not found:
            self.arr[keyindex].append((key,value))
    
    def get(self, key):
        keyindex = self.get_hash(key)
        for element in self.arr[keyindex]:
            if element[0] == key:
                return element[1]
        return -1
        
    def remove(self, key):
        keyindex = self.get_hash(key)
        for idx, element in enumerate(self.arr[keyindex]):
            if element[0] == key:
                del self.arr[keyindex][idx]

## 解题思路和想法
Hash table:

Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables. It is an array whose indexes are obtained using a hash function on the keys. 
Hash function: Converting the string key into a index of an array. Usually for an normal array, we use integer index, list[1], in hashtable
we have string index, list['september'].

Two steps & issues here:
1. Hash function design: the purpose of hash function is to map a key value to an address in the storage space. We could adopt the modulo 
operator as the hash function, since the key value is of integer type. In addition, in order to minimize the potential collisions, it is 
advisable to use a prime number as the base of modulo.

2. Collision handling: There may be the case where two different keys are mapped to the same address. Since collision is inevitable. It's
important to have a strategy to handle that. We can use a tupple to hold all possiable values.
