## 58. Length of Last Word

https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/

My Solution

```python 
#-----------------Solution 1 ----------------------------#
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        # Solution 1: traverse from back to skip space.Then count length from last word
        # Time: O(n) Space: O(1)
        n = len(s)
        i = n-1
        while i >= 0 and s[i] == " ":
            i -= 1
        count = 0
        while i >= 0 and s[i] != " ":
            count += 1
            i -= 1
        return count
#-------------------Solution 2 ----------------------------#
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        # Solution 2: Traverse and count in one loop
        n = len(s)
        i = n-1
        count = 0
        while i >= 0:
            if s[i] != " ":
                count += 1
            elif count > 0:
                return count
            i -= 1
        return count
#-------------------solution 3--------------------------#
class Solution(object):
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s):
        # Solution 3: Use function
        if not s or s.isspace(): return 0
        return len(s.split()[-1])

## 解题思路和想法
This problem is a great example to practice string manipulation.

1. Intuitive method: Traverse from back, skip spaces until non-space charator. Then locate at the last word, count it's length until meet space.

2. In the above approach, we applied 2 loops. One is used to locate the last word, and the other used to calculate the length. If we want to put these 2 steps into 
one loop, the key point is how to define a precise moment that we should start to count the lenght of the words. Be aware I aways not used to use if/elif, it means
we can only go into one case. We put s[i] != " " before length, it means once s[i] == " ", we should go into length > 0 condition.

3. Use function
str.isspace(): this function determines if the str contains only spaces.

str.split(delimiter): this function could split the input string into several substrings, based on the given delimiter (by default, the delimiter is space).
