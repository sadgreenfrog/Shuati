My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        
        """
        Find the shorest path, using BFS to find the least way from 
        0000 to the target, we explore +1, -1 each step in each digit, if the node is in deadends, then stop there. If node == target, return the count
        """
        
        que = [("0000",0)]
        visited = set("0000")
        while que:
            node, count = que.pop(0)
            if node == target:
                return count
            elif node in deadends:
                continue
            for i in range(4):
                digit = int(node[i])
                for move in [-1,1]:
                    new_d = (digit + move) % 10
                    new_node = node[:i] + str(new_d) + node[i+1:] 
                    if new_node not in visited:
                        que.append((new_node, count+1))
                        visited.add(new_node)
        return -1
```
## 思路想法

We can think of this problem as a shortest path problem, we can use BFS to achieve that. 

We tring to check each lock state one by one by using BFS algorithm and then if we are able to reach the target state. If newly
explored state in the deadends states, then we can't go over the state and continue. If not, we can explore by adding and 
subtracting "1" to each digit of the current state from left to right.
