## Reverse String

https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/

My Solution

```python
错误:
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        new = list()
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        j = n - 1
        while i < j:
            new[i],new[j] = s[j],s[i]
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        return new      # 这个会return assigment index out of range
            
        
Modified:
class Solution(object):
    def reverseString(self, s):
        n = len(s)
        i = 0
        j = n - 1
        while i < j:
            s[i],s[j] = s[j],s[i]
            i += 1
            j -= 1
        
```

## Syntax Notes
Our error message tells us the line of code at which our program fails:

The problem with this code is that we are trying to assign a value inside our “new” list to a position that does not exist.

When we create our strawberry array, it has no values. This means that it has no index numbers. 

We can solve this problem in two ways: Solution with append() / Solution with Initializing an Array.
