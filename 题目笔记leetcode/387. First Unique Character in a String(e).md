387. First Unique Character in a String

https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def firstUniqChar(self, s: str) -> int:
        # hashmap to store the occurance as value, char as key
        hashmap = {}
        for x in s:
            if x in hashmap:
                hashmap[x] += 1
            else:
                hashmap[x] = 1
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if hashmap[s[i]] == 1:
                return i
        return -1
#----------------Count-----------------#
class Solution(object):
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s.count(s[i]) == 1:
                return i
        return -1
#----------------Counter----------------#
class Solution(object):
    def firstUniqChar(self, s):
        from collections import Counter
        sc = Counter(s)
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if sc.get(s[i]) == 1:
                return i
        return -1
```
## 解题思路
1. Intuitive thoughts: First thoughs was to create hashmap through 1 for loop. Then use another one to filter out the first 1 occurance letter.

2. Use count of string

count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a string

3. Use counter

A counter is a container that stores elements as dictionary keys, and their counts are stored as dictionary values.

The get() method returns the value of the item with the specified key.
