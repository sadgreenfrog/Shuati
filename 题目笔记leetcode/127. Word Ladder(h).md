## 
127. Word Ladder

https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, s: str) -> bool:
        # 1. 2 pointers, left from head, right from back
        # 2. If isalpha() == true, compare. If != false, skip. Until l == r
        # 3. if s[l] != s[r]: return false
        s = s.lower()
        l, r = 0, len(s)-1
        while l < r:
            if s[l].isalnum() and s[r].isalnum():
                if s[l] != s[r]:
                    return False
                l += 1
                r -=1               
            elif  not s[r].isalnum():
                r -= 1            
            elif not s[l].isalnum():
                l += 1           
        return True
```

## 思路想法
可以转换成图找最短路径.

变图是关键

A graph consists of a finite set of nodes and a set of edges connecting them.

In tree there should be only one path between 2 nodes, can be considered of a special case of graph.

Directed: There is a direction in the way 2 nodes are connected. Example is flight routes between 2 cities.

Undirected: There is no direction to how 2 nodes in the graph are connected. Facebook connections.

Graph and Tree are recursive data structure.
