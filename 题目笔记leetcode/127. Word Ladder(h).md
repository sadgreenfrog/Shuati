127. Word Ladder

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def preprocess(self, wordlist):
        d = {}
        for word in wordlist:
            for c in range(len(word)):
                # 把c一一替换,因为c]是不包括的
                wildcard = word[:c] + '*' + word[c+1:] 
                if wildcard not in d: # 如果字典里没有 x*x，则加进去
                    d[wildcard] = []
                d[wildcard].append(word)
        return d
    
    def ladderLength(self, beginword: str, endword: str, wordlist: List[str]) -> int:
        # 1. Every adjacent words differ by a single letter
        # 2. Begin word not in wordlist
        # 3. RETURN: From begin to end
        # STEP
        # error checking
        if not beginword or not endword or not wordlist or endword not in wordlist: return 0
        # preprocessing
        processewords = self.preprocess(wordlist)
        # BFS
        queue = deque()
        queue.append([beginword,1]) # 一层层遍历
        visited = set()
        while queue:
            curr, level = queue.popleft() # give us a array
            for c in range(len(curr)):
                wildcard = curr[:c] + '*' + curr[c+1:] # 把beginword也放进去
                if wildcard in processewords:
                    for word in processewords[wildcard]:
                        if word == endword:
                            return level + 1
                        # If we are not visit the node already
                        if word not in visited:
                            visited.add(word)
                            queue.append([word, level+1])
        return 0 # If we go through the process and still not find it, then return 0

```

## 思路想法
可以转换成图找最短路径.

变图是关键

A graph consists of a finite set of nodes and a set of edges connecting them.

In tree there should be only one path between 2 nodes, can be considered of a special case of graph.

Directed: There is a direction in the way 2 nodes are connected. Example is flight routes between 2 cities.

Undirected: There is no direction to how 2 nodes in the graph are connected. Facebook connections.

Graph and Tree are recursive data structure.

BFS(Breadth First Search): Search algorithm used to explore nodes and edges of a graph. It is particularly usefil
for finding the shortest path on unweighted graphs.
