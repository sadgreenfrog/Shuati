My Solution

```python
#-------------------Recursive, Exceed time--------------#
class Solution(object):
    def kthGrammar(self, n, k):
        if n == 1: return 0
        path = self.helper(n)        
        return path[k-1]  
    def helper(self, n):
        # termination: if n == 2: return[01]
        # Return nth array
        # Single layer: current l = pre[] + pre[1,0 reverse]
        if n == 2: return [0,1]
        last = self.helper(n-1)
        part2 = last[:]
        for i, x in enumerate(part2):
            if x == 0:
                part2[i] = 1
            else:
                part2[i] = 0
        cur = last + part2
        return cur
#-------------------2nd recursive-----------------------#
```

## 思路想法
1. Brute Force recursive: Generate the nth path from last path. Exceed the time.

2. We can find the 1st part is the same as the last path, and 2nd part is the reversed of the 1st part.

```python
class Solution:
    def kthGrammar(self, n: int, k: int) -> int: 
        def rec(n, k):
            if n == 1:
                if k == 1:
                    return 0
                else:
                    return 1
            half = 2**(n-1) / 2
            if k <= half:
                return rec(n-1, k)
            else:
                return 1 if rec(n-1, k-half) == 0 else 0
        return rec(n, k)
```

Recursive: Find out the relation of n row and (n-1) row. The first half of n row is the same as n-1 row while the second half of n row is the 
opposite of n-1 row.
