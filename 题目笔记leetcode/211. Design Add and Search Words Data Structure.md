## 211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure

https://leetcode.com/problems/design-add-and-search-words-data-structure/

My solution:

```python
class WordDictionary(object):

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        """
        # The reason I put set here is because it's not duplicates, unordered and unchangeable, value is set
        self.wordset = defaultdict(set)
        

    def addWord(self, word):
        """
        :type word: str
        :rtype: None
        """
        length = len(word)
        self.wordset[length].add(word)
        

    def search(self, word):
        """
        :type word: str
        :rtype: bool
        """
        m = len(word)
        for map_word in self.wordset[m]:
            i = 0
            while i < m and (word[i] == '.' or word[i] == map_word[i]):
                i += 1
            if i == m:
                return True
        return False  
```

## 解题思路和想法
Dictionary:

Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values that are used to store data values like a map. Unlike other Data Types that hold only single
value as an element, the Dictionary holds key-value pair. In Dictionary, the key must be unique and immutable. This means that a Python Tuple can be a key
whereas a Python List can not. A Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. 

Defaultdict:

Defaultdict is a container like dictionaries present in the module collections. Defaultdict is a sub-class of the dictionary class that returns a dictionary-like
object. The functionality of both dictionaries and defualtdict are almost same except for the fact that defualtdict never raises a KeyError. It provides a default
value for the key that does not exists.
