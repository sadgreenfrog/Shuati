## 
543. Diameter of Binary Tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/

My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def diameterOfBinaryTree(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
        maxheight = 0
        
        def diameter(root):
            
            nonlocal maxheight
            
            if not root:
                return 0
            
            left = diameter(root.left)
            right = diameter(root.right)
            
            maxheight = max(maxheight, left+right)
            
            return max(left, right) + 1
        
        diameter(root)
        return maxheight
                   
```
## 思路想法

The diameter means the longest path between any of 2 nodes in the tree, it doesn't nessesary to be pass root. And these 2 nodes must be belong to one root node.
We need to find out what is this node, to achieve this, we need to compare the left depth and right depth of each nodes and add them together then return the 
largest one.
