My Solution

```python
#----------------------O(n)T and O(n)S---------------#
class Solution:
    def dailyTemperatures(self, temperatures: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(temperatures)
        stack = []
        ans = [0] * n
        # i is index
        for i in range(n):  
            cur, cur_index = temperatures[i], i
            while stack and stack[-1][1] < cur:
                prev_index, prev = stack.pop()
                ans[prev_index] = cur_index - prev_index
            stack.append((cur_index, cur))
        return ans
                
```

## 思路想法
1.Monotonic Stack: Monotonic decreasing  means that the stack will be sorted in descending order. Monotonic stacks are a good 
option when a problem involves comparing the size of numeric elements, with their order being relevant. On each element, there are
2 posssibilities. If the current day's temp < top of the stack, we will push into stack, this will maintain the sorted property. 
If current day's temp >= top of the stack, it means current day is the first day with a warmer temp than the previous days.
